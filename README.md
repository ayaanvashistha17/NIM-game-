🎮 Nim Game - A Fun Strategy Challenge
Welcome to this C++ implementation of the classic Nim game! This is a perfect project for anyone interested in game development, C++ programming, or just looking for a fun strategy game to play with friends.

🧠 What is Nim?

Nim is a mathematical strategy game where players take turns removing objects from distinct piles. 
In this version, you can remove 1 or 2 tokens at a time from a single pile, and the player who takes the last token loses. 
It's a game of careful planning and anticipation of your opponent's moves!

✨ What Makes This Game Special

Two Exciting Game Modes: Play against a friend or test your skills against the computer
Customizable Setup: Choose how many piles and tokens you want to play with
Visual Game Board: See your piles represented with clear token displays
Personalized Experience: Add player names for a more engaging game
🚀 Getting Started

Prerequisites

Any C++ compiler (like g++, Clang, or Visual Studio's compiler)
Basic command line knowledge (but don't worry, it's simple!)
Installation & Play

Download the nim_game.cpp file
Compile it with your C++ compiler:
bash
g++ -o nim_game nim_game.cpp
Run the game:
bash
./nim_game
🎯 How to Play

Launch the game and you'll see a friendly menu with options
Pick your game mode:
"User vs User" for playing with a friend
"User vs Computer" for a solo challenge against the PC
Set up your game:
Enter player names (make them fun!)
Choose how many piles (heaps) you want
Decide how many tokens to start with
During gameplay:
On your turn, type the letter of a pile followed by how many tokens to take
Example: "B 2" takes 2 tokens from pile B
Remember: you can only take 1 or 2 tokens at a time from one pile!
Strategy tip: The goal is to force your opponent to take the last token, so plan your moves carefully!
💡 Behind the Scenes

This project demonstrates several programming concepts:

Clean code organization with functions for different game aspects
Input validation to prevent illegal moves
Random number generation for token distribution and computer moves
Vector data structures to manage game state
User-friendly menus and displays
